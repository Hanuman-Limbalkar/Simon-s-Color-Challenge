# Simon-s-Color-Challenge

**Simon Game**
This is a simple, interactive Simon Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is based on the classic memory game, where the player needs to repeat the sequence of colors shown by the game. Each time the player successfully repeats the sequence, the game increases in difficulty by adding another color to the sequence.

**Features** :
Start the Game: The game begins when the user presses any key on the keyboard.
Level Progression: With each successful round, the game sequence increases in length, and the difficulty level increases.
User Interaction: The user clicks on the colored buttons to match the sequence shown by the game.
Game Over: If the user clicks the wrong button, the game ends, and the user can restart by pressing any key.
**Technologies Used** :
HTML: For structuring the game interface.
CSS: For styling the game, including button colors, animations, and layout.
JavaScript: For the game logic, handling user input, and managing the game sequence.
**How to Play** :
Press any key to start the game.
The game will show a sequence of colored buttons.
Repeat the sequence by clicking the buttons in the same order.
Each correct repetition will increase the difficulty by adding another color to the sequence.
If you make a mistake, the game will end, and you can press any key to restart.
